I designed and remotely taught a 500-level Data Engineering class for the IT department, open to Seniors and Grad Students with the appropriate IT/CS prerequisites (project-based). At the time, remote-taught, in-person attended classes were not known to this department. The curriculum, class structure, and instruction methods were invented whole cloth to meet the needs of the students. This included securing appropriate hardware for them for their class projects.

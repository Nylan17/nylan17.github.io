Complex software systems grow ever increasingly integrated with our work and lives. Large, multi-component, dynamical software systems and their responsible teams form an ever-evolving, compelling object of study. Studies of incident command and facilitation in similar contexts has proven fruitful for understanding broader patterns and principles. We now turn to functional analysis of the systems themselves, building models thereof out of interviews, systems of record, transcripts of incident response and other artifacts. Findings illuminate the dynamics of such systems and inform operational strengths and weaknesses.
